# ACTL5001 Group3 Project - [Relocation Social Insurance](https://actuarial-control-cycle-part-a-2023-t1.github.io/SOA-Challenge-UNSW-Group3/)

## Executive Summary
Storslysia has contacted Group 3 Consulting to design a social insurance program to combat the increasing economic costs of relocation due to displacement rising from catastrophic climate related events. The program outlined in this report provides both incentive-based voluntary relocation as well as involuntary displacement and damage cover. The incentives program will run for 10 years and provide Ꝕ2000 for relocation to low-risk regions.
This incentive serves as a low-cost program aimed at reducing the overall costs incurred from natural disasters in the country due to involuntary displacement, goods replacement, material and labour costs. Under this program design, it is expected that Storslysia will have reduced overall costs from natural disasters in all forecasted emission scenarios.

## Objectives
The proposed Relocation Social Insurance (RSI) program will address displacement issues resulting from hazard events which is particularly crucial due to a growing concern regarding global warming and climate change. The RSI program has both a proactive and reactive approach to manage displacement costs within the country. The program offers a voluntary relocation incentive payment to those who currently live in a high-risk region when they relocate to a low-risk region before a hazardous event occurs. Involuntary displacement cover is offered to relocate people who live in a property which has been significantly damaged from a hazardous event. Historic property damage costs are large and have been analysed in detail to understand potential future displacement costs which is demonstrated in Appendix A.1. With this voluntary movement, the program aims to reduce Storslysia’s catastrophe-related displacement costs under all forecasted scenarios.
The RSI program is offered to the entire population of Storslysia and is designed with consideration to key demographic information. Furthermore, expected future program costs have been estimated to ensure that total costs remain below 10% of GDP. This is a key consideration which will enable the program to remain sustainable in the long run. A conservative approach has been utilised in which a high emissions scenario has high levels of inflation and a generous margin have been allocated to confidently assure that costs will not exceed this threshold.

## Program Design
### 3.1 Claim Lodgement Requirements
### 3.2 Coverage Limitations
### 3.3 Policy Incentives
The program has a few key incentives embedded in its design to reduce the overall economic costs of displacement within the country. The key incentives are outlined below:
1. Bonus relocation incentive payment
A bonus relocation payment of Ꝕ2000 will be provided to those living in owner occupied properties who voluntarily relocate from a high-risk area to a low-risk area prior to a hazard event.
2. Community disaster awareness program
A community disaster awareness program is set up to creative awareness of the program as well as inform the community of the risks of continuing to live within regions that are deemed to be high-risk. The program will be organised by the taskforce and a variety of awareness tools will be utilised. A key tool will be holding sessions and talks at local community centres in which our environmental experts will provide key insights into the increasing number of environmental disasters and the impact of climate change.
